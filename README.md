# Concurrent_and_Parallel_Python

Examples for concurrent and parallel programming in Python.

Based on the splendid courses by Barron Stone and Olivia Chiu Stone (both using Pythons threading and multiprocessing modules):
- [Python Parallel and Concurrent Programming Part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-parallel-and-concurrent-programming-part-1/)
- [Python Parallel and Concurrent Programming Part 2](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-parallel-and-concurrent-programming-part-2)

In the exercises folder, I have tried to find solutions to the exercises of the course using [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), though admittedly, these are just any solutions (as of March 2024 I'm practicing the syntax), not the most optimal ones. Better solutions are discussed on the course.
